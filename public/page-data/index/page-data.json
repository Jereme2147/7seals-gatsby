Maybe let athletes know they can adjust their reps from a \"hip\" driven press to a shoulder press.  This seems to move the focus from the quads to the shoulders and helps you keep moving.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/10/19</h3>\n<p>If athletes can't touch and go with Rx weight for 5 reps with excellent form, they should probably scale.  I think this is an excellent workout, but the potential for injury is certainly there.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/11/19</h3>\n<p>I think the strength is clear. Just to be clear, I'm looking for a 3 second negative on the first emom. Weight should be static, but I'm guessing most are going to struggle to find the appropriate weight.  No rest between emoms.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/13/19</h3>\n<p>This one has been tested.  It's a pretty crushing. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/14/19</h3>\n<p>Most of this is clear, try to keep the strength to arounbd 15 minutes if possible. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}
