The s2oh hits you hard and fast.  3 rounds is great. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/3/19</h3>\n<p>Strength: Go as heavy as you can for the emom. Weight is dynamic.  Watch arching of the back.\nMetcon: Rest built in just to make things worse.  Enjoy. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/4/19</h3>\n<p>As always keep an eye on pushup form.  Also, lets pay particular attention to walking lunges.  I've noticed a trend of not standing up entirely (full hip extention).  Lets make sure everyone is finishing their reps. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/6/19</h3>\n<p>Figuring out the appropriate weight for this one is going to be difficult.  As noted, if the althlete can do 10+ with the rx weight, they need to be Rx+.  If the athlete doesn't have 5 with whatever weight they've choosen, then scale down to a more manageble weight.  This should be a sub 10 minute wod.  In all reality, I'd like to see it sub 5.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/7/19</h3>\n<p>I think it's clear, divide all reps however you choose.  40 total cals on buy in and cash out, not each.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"nov-19-week5"}}}
