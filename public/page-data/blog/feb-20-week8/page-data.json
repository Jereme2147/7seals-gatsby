Strength 2: For the box step ups, standing with one side to the box - put one foot on top.  Try not to push off with the grounded foot.  It's hard not to though.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>3/25/20</h3>\n<p>Deadlift weight should be a weight athletes can safely TnG 10 reps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>3/27/20</h3>\n<p>Strength: Pick a starting weight about 90 pounds less than your current PR.  The goal is to PR. Add 10lbs per round.  (10 is just a suggestion, a lot will need to add 5 to avoid starting with negative weight lol.) </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>3/28/20</h3>\n<p>A, B, C.
