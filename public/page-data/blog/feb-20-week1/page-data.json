Pretty simple. Hit the safest 5 rep max you can.  Lets be picky.  I'd like to see coaches being\npicky about depth.  A 300# squat above parallel isn't really a 300# squat.  I'd rather see someone improve their form\nand not increase weight.\nMetcon: Pretty clear. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>2/4/20</h3>\n<p>!!!!!!!!!Important!!!!!! First minute is 10 alternating kb ground to overhead.  No Ski Erg. 53/35.  Should see some 100 rep scores.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>2/5/20</h3>\n<p>Most of us have done this.  25+ rounds is legit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>2/7/20</h3>\n<p>Strength: Dynamic weight at your own risk lol.  Have fun with that.  Score heaviest.\nStrength 2: Exercises should be done one after the other with minimal rest. Extended rest between rounds is fine.  Choose your weight for SLRDL and step ups.  I'd avoid a barbell for step ups.  For SLRDL, be sure the hips aren't opening up too far.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>2/8/20</h3>\n<p>Hold DB however you choose. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"feb-20-week1"}}}
