It's not easy.  As a coach, if you see an opportunity to modify that I've missed, by all means make that adjustment.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3>3/16/20</h3>\n<p>pretty clear.  Another long one. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>3/17/20</h3>\n<p>Strength 1: I've modified this one.  I feel like even sharing on the front squat is possible.  Wipe down shared bars and avoid licking each other.\nStrength 2: If there's a way to do the part I marked through, awesome. Otherwise, plop a plate on your back and do pushups. Each should have minimal rest between. And don't lick each other.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>3/18/20</h3>\n<p>Strength/skill: I think it's clear. Metcon: Yes I know the pushups conflict with yesterday. The lunge will be the focus. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>3/20/20</h3>\n<p>Complex: looking for a little metabolic element in this. This is touch and go. Metcon: will suck. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>3/21/20</h3>\n<p>Took AB out.  The way this is intended to work: Athlete 1 runs 400, A2 does HSPU reps, then A1 does reps and A2 runs, then box over,...... Score total reps.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"feb-20-week7"}}}
