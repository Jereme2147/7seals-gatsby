I think this should be easier than the last one on thanksgiving.  Time cap is up to coach.  I doubt anyone is finishing this sub 45 minutes though.  These things are always really hard to tell. Weights are light, I feel like it should move fairly quickly.  Not sure anyone really needs to Rx+.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/24/19</h3>\n<p>This feels like you're screaming through it. Until the pushups.. Pushups are 40% of the wod. There's two movements that we should spend time correcting. Both pushups and situps. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/27/19</h3>\n<p>All I can say is blame Lail. I recently did 200 stepups with a 35lb kb.  That took me 12 minutes unbroken. If I'm remembering correctly, pros were taking an hour or so for this. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>12/28/19</h3>\n<p>Pretty clear, divide all work as needed. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}}]}}}
