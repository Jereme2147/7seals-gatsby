The goal is to PR. Add 10lbs per round.  (10 is just a suggestion, a lot will need to add 5 to avoid starting with negative weight lol.) </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>3/28/20</h3>\n<p>A, B, C.

Wipe down shared bars and avoid licking each other.\nStrength 2: If there's a way to do the part I marked through, awesome. Otherwise, plop a plate on your back and do pushups. Each should have minimal rest between. And don't lick each other.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>3/18/20</h3>\n<p>Strength/skill: I think it's clear. Metcon: Yes I know the pushups conflict with yesterday. The lunge will be the focus. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>3/20/20</h3>\n<p>Complex: looking for a little metabolic element in this. This is touch and go.
